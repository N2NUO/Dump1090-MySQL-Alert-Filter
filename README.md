### Dump1090-MySQL-Alert-Filter

Writes Dump1090-mutability data to MySql database and e-mail/pushover alerts on special events. you can set how often the script writes to database and looks for alert condition. you can specify the area (lat/lon/alt) to be observed and filter for special hex and/or flight numbers. You can globally switch to wildcard-search and then use % as wildcard for missing characters in hex- or flight-text-file - upper and lower case does not matter. in addition you can set hex/flight filter to operate only within lat/lon/alt limit or within whole range of site.
